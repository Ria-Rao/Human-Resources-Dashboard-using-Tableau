# Human-Resources-Dashboard-using-Tableau
I recently created this Human Resources Dashboard using Tableau to visualize key HR metrics. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of employee data and can help HR teams make data-driven decisions.

Key Features:
-Employee headcount: Active, hired, and terminated employees.
-Department-wise distribution for better organizational insights.
-Demographic analysis including gender, education, and age.
-Correlation between education levels and performance.
-Income distribution by education and gender.
-Age & Salary comparison across various roles.

By visualizing this data, businesses can:
-Understand workforce composition. 
-Identify salary trends and potential pay gaps. 
-Analyze performance based on education levels. 
-Gain insights into departmental staffing needs.
